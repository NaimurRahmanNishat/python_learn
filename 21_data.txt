Bit and byte appear to be very similar terms but there is a vast difference between them.
They are the units that are used in computers. It is used in deciding the speed of data 
transmission between CPU and register, RAM and CPU, and so on. At the same time, it also 
decides the speed with which data is received in networking. 

Example: 2Mbps or 1Gbps.


Bit
Bit is the smallest unit of the computer. It is usually represented with digits 0 and 1.

    a "bit" is atomic: the smallest unit of storage
    A bit stores just a 0 or 1
    "In the computer it's all 0's and 1's" ... bits
    Anything with two separate states can store 1 bit
    In a chip: electric charge = 0/1
    In a hard drive: spots of North/South magnetism = 0/1
    A bit is too small to be much use
    Group 8 bits together to make 1 byte 


Byte
Byte is made of 8 bits. It is used in determining the system storage. Byte is the most common 
term used in computing. It is used to represent 2^8 = 256 different values. 

    One byte = collection of 8 bits
    e.g. 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0
    One byte can store one character, e.g. 'A' or 'x' or '$'
